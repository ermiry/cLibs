# clibs

**clibs** is a collection of my personal C libraries that I have crated and gather over the years. It mainly contains generic collections implementations such as lists and trees with an easy to use api interface. You can find a the documentation for each module here https://ermiry.com/clibs. 

### Usage

Once you have picked up what you need from the src folder, you need to grab the corresponding .h file from the include folder. The .h file is the .c library and you need it to interact with it, unless you want a custom implementation.

Any dependency is indicated in the documentation.
